1. Cool use of regex, I have no idea how that works.
2. it loads and works great in colab
3. could be interesting to add additional functionality like pulling out and saving the hyperlink instead of deleting it
  or saying just what website it is (i.e. wikipedia, google)
4. need to add some docstrings to the functions
5. some lines run a little long and could be moved to a new line (see pep8)
